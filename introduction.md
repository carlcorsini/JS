# Introduction to JavaScript

------

### Shamelessly taken from Wikipedia:

### Alongside [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). JavaScript enables interactive [web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) and is an essential part of [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application). The vast majority of [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) use it, and major [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) have a dedicated [JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine) to execute it.



- Designed in 1995 by Brendan Eich along with Netscape, Mozilla and ECMA International.



- According to the [2018 Stack Overflow Developers Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology) JavaScript is the Most Popular Technology with 69.8% of developers using JavaScript, followed by HTML at 68.5% and CSS at 65.1%



- There are standard releases of JavaScript dubbed ESCMAScript (or ES)



- Currently ES6 is most commonly used, but the language is still improving 23 years later!



- Check out [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) wiki to see the list of past and future releases of JavaScript



- It's what makes a web page come to life



- High level language



- Interpreted programming language



- Weakly typed



- Dynamic



- Prototype based



A lot of these terms likely won't make sense if you don't have a background in computer science. We'll take it step by step to get you comfortable with some basic JavaScript.

You'll be writing Web-Apps in no time!

# Exercise

To get comfortable with the JavaScript language we will use a tool called *repl.it*. *Repl.it* is a site that acts a sort of programmers playground. It allows you to create developer environments within a web application with ease. For this section we'll use a JavaScrip *repl.it* where you can play around with some code

1. To get started open a JavaScript [repl.it ](https://repl.it)
  - You'll first need to create an account (You may link your github account or create a new one from email)
  - Find the button at the top part of the screen that says "new repl" and select JavaScript:
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KuLejeI.png" title="source: imgur.com" width="500" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lspl6nq.png" title="source: imgur.com" width="400" />
  - It is a good idea to name your "repl(s)" so you can refer back to them, otherwise repl will give it a random generated name and it will be difficult to keep track.



2. Copy and paste this code into the middle white section of the repl and click "run"
  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello World!')
  ```



3. Your screen should look something like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hsWToqB.png" title="source: imgur.com" width="800" />

4. Copy and paste this code and click "run"
  ```javascript
  // console.log('Hello World!')
  ```
  - What happened? Adding `//` before a line of code will "comment" the code out, disabling the line from being run. You can use comments to give yourself notes about what is happening with your code, or you can comment out lines of code that may be broken or not needed.



5. If your screen looks like the above image, wave back to your computer and move on. Congrats! You just ran your first console log. If your screen doesn't look like the image fear not! Raise your hand or ask your neighbor, we'll figure this out together!



`console.log()` allows you to print information to your "console". You will quickly become close friends with the `console.log()`.
